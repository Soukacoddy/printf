## ðŸš€ About _Printf Function


#### _printf is a custom implementation of the C standard library function printf. It was developed as part of a software development course to practice low-level programming in C.This implementation supports the %c, %s, and %% conversion specifiers, and returns the number of characters printed to the standard output stream. By using _printf instead of printf, developers can have a better understanding of how printf works under the hood and can gain insights into how to optimize code for performance. _printf is licensed under the MIT License, and contributions are welcome.
